# Linear Search Vs Binary Search

An exercise in COP3530 Data Structures and Algorithms asked us to implement
Linear and Binary searches and to compare the search times.  When there were few
items to search through(n), the difference between the two searches was not very
significant but as the number of  objects increased towards millions, the search
times began to diverge significantly and binary was finishing its searches much
faster than linear search was.
